## Creating Your First LiaScript File

### Step 1: Basic File Structure

LiaScript files use the `.md` extension. Let's create `lesson-1.md`:

```markdown
<!--
author: Dr. Jane Smith
email: jane.smith@university.edu
version: 1.0.0
language: en
narrator: US English Female

comment: This is an introduction to research methods using LiaScript

## Interactive Example: Hypothesis Formation

Let's practice creating a research hypothesis!

**Research Question:** Does coffee consumption affect student performance?

**Your Hypothesis:**

[[hypothesis]]

**Explanation:**

[hypothesis](A good hypothesis might be: "Students who consume moderate amounts of coffee will show improved test scores compared to those who consume no coffee or excessive amounts.")

## Summary

2. Name it `lesson-1.md`
3. Paste your LiaScript content
4. Scroll down to "Commit new file"
5. Add a commit message: "Add first lesson on research methods"
6. Click "Commit new file"

---

## Advanced LiaScript Features

### Mathematical Formulas

LiaScript supports LaTeX math rendering:

```markdown
The correlation coefficient is calculated as:

$$r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$
```

### Code Execution

Students can run code directly in the browser:

```markdown
Try this Python code:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
data = np.random.normal(100, 15, 1000)

# Create histogram
plt.hist(data, bins=30, alpha=0.7)
plt.title('Sample Distribution')
plt.show()
```
```

### Surveys and Data Collection

```markdown
Please rate your confidence level:

[( )] Very Low
[( )] Low
[( )] Moderate
[( )] High
[( )] Very High

Additional comments:

[[feedback]]
```

### Audio Narration

Add the `narrator` property in your header to enable text-to-speech:

```markdown
<!--
narrator: US English Female
-->

# This content will be read aloud!

Click the speaker icon to hear the narration.
```

---

## Publishing with GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source," select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch
6. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Access Your Content

Your LiaScript content will be available at:
`https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/filename.md`

**But wait!** GitHub Pages serves raw Markdown. To render LiaScript properly:

### Step 3: Using LiaScript's CDN

Access your content through LiaScript's viewer:
`https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name/filename.md`

### Step 4: Creating a Custom Domain (Optional)

For a professional URL like `courses.yourname.com`:

1. Purchase a domain
2. In repository settings, add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings with your provider
4. Enable HTTPS

## Best Practices for Academic Content

### Content Structure

**Start with Clear Objectives:**
```markdown
## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define key concepts
- Apply theoretical frameworks
- Analyze case studies
```

**Use Progressive Disclosure:**
- Start with overview
- Build complexity gradually  
- Provide multiple examples
- Include practice opportunities

### Engagement Strategies

**Frequent Interaction:**
- Quiz every 5-7 minutes
- Think-pair-share prompts
- Reflection questions
- Real-world applications

**Multimedia Balance:**
- 60% text content
- 25% interactive elements
- 15% multimedia (images, videos, audio)

### Accessibility Considerations

**Visual:**
- Use high contrast colors
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure readable font sizes

**Cognitive:**
- Break content into chunks
- Provide clear navigation
- Include progress indicators
- Offer multiple content formats

### Assessment Integration

```markdown
### Knowledge Check

Which research method is best for exploring a new phenomenon?

[( )] Quantitative survey
[( )] Experimental design
[(X)] Qualitative exploration
[( )] Meta-analysis

**Explanation:** When little is known about a topic, qualitative methods help researchers understand the complexity and nuances before developing structured measurements.
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem 1: Content Not Displaying Properly

**Symptoms:** Raw Markdown showing instead of interactive content

**Solution:** Ensure you're accessing content through LiaScript viewer:
`https://liascript.github.io/course/?[YOUR-GITHUB-PAGES-URL]`

### Problem 2: Images Not Loading

**Symptoms:** Broken image icons

**Solutions:**
1. Check image paths (case-sensitive)
2. Ensure images are uploaded to repository
3. Use relative paths: `![description](./images/chart.png)`

### Problem 3: Math Formulas Not Rendering

**Symptoms:** Raw LaTeX code visible

**Solutions:**
1. Wrap inline math in `$...$`
2. Wrap block math in `$$...$$`
3. Escape special characters if needed

### Problem 4: Audio/Video Issues

**Common Issues and Fixes:**
- File format compatibility (use MP3 for audio, MP4 for video)
- File size limits (keep under 100MB)
- HTTPS requirements for embedded content

### Problem 5: Collaboration Conflicts

**Symptoms:** Merge conflicts when multiple people edit

**Prevention:**
1. Communicate about who's editing what
2. Use branches for major changes
3. Pull latest changes before starting work
4. Make frequent, small commits
